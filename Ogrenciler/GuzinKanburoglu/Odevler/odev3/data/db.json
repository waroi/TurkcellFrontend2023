        "writing": "We are into week two of World Vegan Month already! Over the past seven days, we have been sharing informative graphics across our social media platforms to help bring veganism back to the basics. Answering questions like 'What is veganism?' and 'How do I avoid animal use in clothing?', our shareable graphics have helped educate those interested in veganism and others who have never even come across it before.\n\nThis week we will be delving a little deeper into how animals are exploited for food, including farming statistics and common mutilations that they face on farms.\n\nLet's take a look...",

        "writing": "Spicy Tofu Burgers! YES. Crumbled tofu pressed together with lemongrass, sriracha, and fresh herbs, all browned up into a delicious flavor-bomb burger.This might be my bigger summer surprise recipe yet: the fact that tofu, crumbled and pressed together with lemongrass, sriracha, mint, cilantro, and basil, and browned up into a delicious, flavor-bomb burger served on a toasted brioche bun with spicy mayo and some delicately sliced fresh veggies can, in fact, be ONE OF MY FAVORITE BURGERS that I’ve ever made.\n\nAnd that’s saying a lot because I love a lot of burgers (wild rice burgers! cauliflower burgers! salmon burgers!).\n\nBut specifically in this case, when I say burger I actually mean VEGAN burger, because remember that the base of this beast is a block of humble tofu. I know. I’m as shocked as you are.",

        "writing": "Mappy-Land is one of those games that's often overlooked and I've even seen it needlessly ridiculed but let me assure you; this is one fun game and I have very fond memories of playing it when I was a youngun. For starters, the core gameplay from the arcade game remains intact where you bounce on trampolines while navigating through stages that are composed of various hallways. Although you can't open doors to snag enemy cats, there are plenty of other gimmicks and gadgets within Mappy-Land that more than make up for that. Meanwhile, the catchy soundtrack and variety of colourful themed environments make it a joy to play. ",
