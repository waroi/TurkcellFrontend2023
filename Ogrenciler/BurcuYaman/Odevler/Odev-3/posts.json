      "content": "It’s hard not to speak in superlatives when describing this epic cradle of civilisation. No other city in the world has been besieged so many times, so greatly was it coveted by peoples outside its walls. No other city on earth sits astride two continents. Not just age old, for centuries it was the most multicultural city in Europe, on whose streets more than a dozen languages were spoken, from Italian to Persian, Greek to Arabic. Above all it was a city made for trade, built for business.Established on a triangular spit of land (the area today dominated by the Blue Mosque and Aya Sofya), the original town was surrounded by water on three sides. This was no shy retiring little colony, but a confident centre of commerce designed to govern one of the most significant waterways in the world, the Bosphorus. Control of this narrow channel connecting the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, ensured political clout, a constant stream of innovative ideas, and of course money, in the shape of traffic and taxes.",

      "content": "Comparing React to other frameworks the best thing about React is how exposed you are while working with it, as there is no template DSL (JSX compiles to sensible JavaScript), the component API has always been simpler with the addition of React Hooks and the framework offers a very little abstraction outside the core UI elements.Template Literal are enclosed by the backtick (` `) character instead of double or single quotes.They can contain placeholder and these are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (${}) and the expression in the placeholder and the text between the backticks get passed to the function.",

      "content": "Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and has a distinct rusty red appearance and two unusual moons. The Red Planet is a cold, desert world within our solar system. It has a very thin atmosphere, but the dusty, lifeless (as far as we know it) planet is far from dull.Phenomenal dust storms can grow so large they engulf the entire planet, temperatures can get so cold that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere condenses directly into snow or frost, and marsquakes — a Mars version of an earthquake — regularly shake things up. Therefore, it is no surprise that this little red rock continues to intrigue scientists and is one of the most explored bodies in the solar system, according to NASA Science(opens in new tab). ",

Since ancient times, the guitar has gone through numerous changes, from its origins until it reaches the form it currently has; This is a stringed musical instrument that has spread all over the world.The origin of the guitar is not very clear, as some scholars say the instrument that preceded the guitar arrived in Spain in the 8th century during the invasion of the Arabs. Others say that its origins belong to the time of the Greeks, who designed an instrument with some similarities to the current guitar but straight edges. It had four strings, but in reality, there is no detailed history of the guitar.",
