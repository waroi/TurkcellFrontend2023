        <h2>What is D&D?</h2>
        <p>
          In Dungeons & Dragons, the players form an adventuring party who
          explore fantasy worlds together as they embark on epic quests and
          level up in experience. The Dungeon Master (also known as the DM) is
          the game's referee and storyteller. There’s no winning or losing in
          D&D—at least, not in the conventional way. Dungeons & DragonsAt its
          heart, D&D is a game that focuses on storytelling. The dice just help
          you along. Everything is your decision, from what you look like, to
          how you act, to what happens next. The collective creativity in your
          D&D game builds stories that you’ll tell again and again—ranging from
          the stuff of legend to absurd incidents that’ll make you laugh years
          later. Have fun and remember the golden rule—never split the party!

            Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD)is a fantasy
            tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax
            and Dave Arneson.The game was first published in 1974 by Tactical
            Studies Rules, Inc. (TSR). It has been published by Wizards of the
            Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) since 1997. The game was derived
            from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game Chainmail
            serving as the initial rule system. D&D's publication is commonly
            recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the
            role-playing game industry,and also deeply influenced video games,
            especially the role-playing video game genre.
