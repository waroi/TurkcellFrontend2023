      <h2>What is D&D?</h2>
      <p>
        In Dungeons & Dragons, the players form an adventuring party who
        explore fantasy worlds together as they embark on epic quests and
        level up in experience. The Dungeon Master (also known as the DM) is
        the game's referee and storyteller. There’s no winning or losing in
        D&D—at least, not in the conventional way. Dungeons & DragonsAt its
        heart, D&D is a game that focuses on storytelling. The dice just help
        you along. Everything is your decision, from what you look like, to
        how you act, to what happens next. The collective creativity in your
        D&D game builds stories that you’ll tell again and again—ranging from
        the stuff of legend to absurd incidents that’ll make you laugh years
        later. Have fun and remember the golden rule—never split the party!

          Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD)is a fantasy
          tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax
          and Dave Arneson.The game was first published in 1974 by Tactical
          Studies Rules, Inc. (TSR). It has been published by Wizards of the
          Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) since 1997. The game was derived
          from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game Chainmail
          serving as the initial rule system. D&D's publication is commonly
          recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the
          role-playing game industry,and also deeply influenced video games,
          especially the role-playing video game genre.
